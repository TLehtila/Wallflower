# Wallflower
The Wallflower is an interactive art program created for University of Plymouth Computer Science COMP3000 module.

It works by taking a feed from two cameras placed under and to the right of the display, and processing the information to detect movement with OpenCV.

The movement captured is converted into coordinates in which flowers appear. The flowers will then float upwards and off the screen.

If no movement is detected for a while, a bigger flower will appear, prompting users to wave at display.
